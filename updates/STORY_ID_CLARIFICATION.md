# Story ID Clarification

## Change Made

Updated README to clarify that users should NOT include Story IDs when creating new stories in markdown files.

## Reason

Jira automatically generates Story IDs sequentially based on the project key:
- PROJ-1
- PROJ-2
- PROJ-3
- etc.

Users cannot predict or control these IDs, so including them in markdown would be:
- ❌ Misleading
- ❌ Confusing
- ❌ Potentially incorrect

## Updated Sections

### 1. Markdown Format

**Before:**
```markdown
- Story: PROJ-124 Add User Profile Page
```

**After:**
```markdown
- Story: Add User Profile Page
```

**Added Note:**
> ⚠️ **Do not include Story ID** (e.g., `PROJ-123`) in new stories
> - Jira automatically generates Story IDs sequentially (PROJ-1, PROJ-2, etc.)
> - Only include Story ID when updating existing issues

### 2. Quick Start

Added a practical example showing:
- How to create first story WITHOUT Story ID
- Note explaining Jira will auto-generate the ID
- Expected result (e.g., `PROJ-1`)

### 3. Limitations

Updated to clarify:
- **New issues**: Story ID auto-generated by Jira
- **Existing issues**: Story ID required for updates
- **Create-only mode**: Default behavior

## User Workflow

### Creating New Issues

1. Write markdown WITHOUT Story ID:
```markdown
- Story: Add Login Feature
  Description: Implement user authentication
  Priority: High
```

2. Run import:
```bash
npm run md-to-jira
```

3. Jira creates issue with auto-generated ID:
```
✅ Created: PROJ-1
```

### Updating Existing Issues

1. Export from Jira:
```bash
npm run jira-to-md
```

2. Edit exported file (includes Story ID):
```markdown
## Story: PROJ-1 Add Login Feature

### Story ID
PROJ-1

### Description
Implement user authentication (updated)
```

3. Re-import with update mode:
```bash
ALLOW_JIRA_UPDATE=true npm run md-to-jira
```

## Benefits

### For Users
- ✅ Less confusion about Story IDs
- ✅ Clear workflow for new vs existing issues
- ✅ Matches Jira's actual behavior
- ✅ Prevents errors from incorrect IDs

### For Documentation
- ✅ More accurate examples
- ✅ Clear expectations
- ✅ Better user experience
- ✅ Reduced support questions

## Examples in README

### New Story (Correct)
```markdown
- Story: Add User Profile Page
  Description: Create a user profile page
  Priority: High
```

### Existing Story (From Export)
```markdown
## Story: PROJ-123 Implement User Authentication

### Story ID
PROJ-123

### Description
Implement JWT-based authentication
```

## Key Points

1. **New Stories**: Never include Story ID
2. **Exported Stories**: Always include Story ID
3. **Updates**: Story ID required to identify issue
4. **Auto-generation**: Jira controls ID sequence

## Documentation Updates

- ✅ Markdown Format section
- ✅ Quick Start example
- ✅ Limitations section
- ✅ Important notes added
- ✅ Clear workflow explanation
